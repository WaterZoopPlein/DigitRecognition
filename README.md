# Digit Recognition v1
My first attempt at no black-box digit recognition machine learning algorithm. Inspired by Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course.

# How to use
* Create folder named **data**
* Download all data set from https://github.com/cvdfoundation/mnist
* Extract them into **data** folder
* Install numpy, scipy, matplotlib into your python environment.
* The notebook also uses python-mnist from ```pip install python-mnist``` to read the downloaded data.
* Run **Digit Recognition Program.ipynb** to generate **theta** file, a text file of number matrix which is used to guess your handwriting input.
* Draw number on **test.png** and run **Number predictor.ipynb**
